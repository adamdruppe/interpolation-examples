These are examples of using the D interpolation strings as implemented in:

https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/15715

You must build and use that compiler to try these yourself, but you can browse the code from here.

To just look at how it would be used from the end user perspective, look at top-level .d files. To see library implementations, look in the lib folder.

PRs welcome to this to add more use cases.

Please note: NONE of the examples in this repository is part of the proposal to change the compiler. Those changes are in the mentioned PR above. This repository is just a set of example use cases.
